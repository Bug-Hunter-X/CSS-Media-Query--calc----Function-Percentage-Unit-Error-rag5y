The solution involves explicitly specifying units for the percentage values within the `calc()` function, ensuring that the browser correctly interprets the calculation.

```css
@media (max-width: calc(100vw - 50px)) {
  /* Styles here */
}
```
By adding `vw` (viewport width), we explicitly define that the percentage is relative to the viewport width. This removes ambiguity and ensures that the media query works reliably.  Similarly, use `vh` for viewport height.  This explicitness avoids potential browser inconsistencies.
